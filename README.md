<h3> What is Treasure Game ?</h3>



This project is a treasure hunting game where players navigate through both stationary and moving objects to collect all treasures. In the game, the main goal of the character is to explore a map filled with various obstacles and traps to find and collect hidden treasures. Stationary objects are fixed barriers that players must maneuver around, including rocks, trees, and walls.

On the other hand, moving objects are dynamic obstacles that the player must actively avoid, wandering around the map. The character collects all treasures without hitting these obstacles and displays the location and types of treasures on the screen.
